# ðŸš€ Creativity

Creativity, is a repository where I develop my crazy ideas, and use that fuel to study technology.


# Goal

The goal with this repo, is to expand my knowledge in general.
I want to inspire people to create something that they enjoy, and have fun while doing that.


### Want to help me/others to get inspired?
[Cliick here](https://github.com/baptixta/creativity/issues/1) to join us.
